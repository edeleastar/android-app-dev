  </h4>
  <blockquote>
    <p>This is a short lab whose aim is to provide a detailed explanation of event handling</p>
<ul>
<li>A small project is developed to show how the the process works.</li>
<li>Three separate approaches are demonstrated:<ul>
<li>A <strong>standalone</strong> method</li>
<li>A method that uses an <strong>anonymous class</strong></li>
<li>A method we refer to as the <strong>delegate</strong> method</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The key classes used in this lab have been designed to correspond closely to those used in MyRent.</li>
<li>Before working on this lab it would help to revise the lab <em>Java Interface type</em> that was presented during the programming course.</li>
<li>The lab concludes with an exercise to test your knowledge of the subject.</li>
<li>Accompanying the lab will be a short associated presentation.</li>
</ul>
