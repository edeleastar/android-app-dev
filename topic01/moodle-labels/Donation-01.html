    <p>With this range of tools installed we can start the process of acquainting ourselves with the android SDK and the workflow involved in authoring, building and deploying applications. In the 'Donation-01' lab below we proceed to explore in detail the creating of a simple activity class + the associated layout. This process will seem quite complex on first contact - but as we proceed through the labs over the next few sessions the deep structure should start to emerge.</p>
