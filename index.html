         <p>Android, like IOS, has introduced a new visual language for interaction on the devices it supports. This language is different from previous graphical environments (Windows, OSX), and is optimised for touch based interaction. Here we review some of the major elements of this language and become acquainted with the some of the primary interaction patterns.</p><p>If you have completed this lab (but not the exercises yet) then we can review your achievements so far, and closely inspect the code we introduced to accommodate the new activity + the list. We will also review the challenges.</p><p>This lab presents the solution to the series of challenges in the Donation-02 lab. If you have completed these challenges you may just with to examine our solutions, which may be largely the same as yours. If you have not completed them all, the incorporated these into your solution now and have a got at the exercises at the end of this lab. You should be able to complete these exercises.</p><p>This simple application is already composed of a range of classes related to each other in via different types of relationships. We can capture this design graphically in UML, exploring the true nature of the structure of the app.</p>

         <p>Android is a sophisticated, multi-layered operating system encompassing a wide range of features, capabilities and components. This is organised into a 'Stack', whereby each layer communicates with the layer immediately below. Here we review this stack and briefly examine the primary components at each layer.</p><p>We should now begin to have a firm understanding of structure of an android project as presented in Eclipse. Here we review the MyRent v00 in detail, and review all its working parts</p><p>Although the app is still relatively simple, this app crosses a threshold in our understanding of Android.The Activity class implements multiple interfaces, each implementation responding to different widgits. Here we review this in detail, as it represents a pattern we will see in most of the application we develop.</p><p>This is the specification for the first assignment. When you complete the MyRent labs, you should consider turning your attention to this specification here, and move on with one of the required features. Sometimes you may have to do some independent research.</p><p>Central to almost all Android applications is the notion of an event. How events are intercepted and handled is an aspect of all android programmes. Here we review the underlying Java mechanisms used in this context</p>

In particular, we explore navigation within a single application, which can yield some interesting and surprising subtleties.</p><p>The Activity is at the heart of almost all android applications. You have already experience in designing and implementing a number of simple ones.

         <p>Last time we explored briefly navigation within an app. In this session we continue this discussion, with a focus on navigation from the users perspective, looking at how a user can arrive into an app, and also how they may move between apps.</p><p>We review the structure, model and code in the MyRent 01 and 02 applications. The application at this stage has 2 views - sometimes called a 'Master-Detail' pattern. The Master presents a list of items which, if selected, will launch a detail view presenting the individual items. The List if items is randomly generated at application startup, and cannot be extended.</p><p>In this version we introduced an action bar, containing an option to enable a new Residence Item to be added. This residence is created in the ResidenceActivity, and will be added to the list. Additionally, the ResidenceActivity now supports a simple dialog to allow the user to select a date.</p>

         <p>Last time we explored briefly navigation within an app. In this session we continue this discussion, with a focus on navigation from the users perspective, looking at how a user can arrive into an app, and also how they may move between apps.</p><p>To date we have seen a small number of file formats for data, namely CSV and YAML. These are common and well suited to a range of simple applications. In Android we often use XML and Json. Here we review examples of all of these briefly.</p><p>The android SDK comes with a subset of the Java JDK libraries. This subset is significantly reduced from the range available in the JDK. Amonhg these is the Streams library, which we use for simple file I/O.</p><p>In MyRent Lab 04 we incorporated a simple serialization mechanism to write Java objects to a Json file format. This required some significant enhancements to the models package, including a completely new Serializer class. Here we review these classes in detail.</p><p>Navigating "up" (as opposed to 'back') must be explicity implemented in the application. It involves enabling the up button in the action bar, handling the resultant event and also declaring the parent/child relationship in the manifest.</p>

TDD is a technique that promotes reasonable simple unit test as precursor to implementation, significantly enhancing the robustness of the classes under test.</p><p>The Play framework has very specific test support - facilitated via a variant of the JUnit libraries. This enables play applications to be launched in 'test' mode, and specific simple tests executed on the application classes.</p><p>The focus on the tests for the moment is the Model classes only.
