        <h1>Android Application Development</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Android, like IOS, has introduced a new visual language for interaction on the devices it supports. This language is different from previous graphical environments (Windows, OSX), and is optimised for touch based interaction. Here we review some of the major elements of this language and become acquainted with the some of the primary interaction patterns.</p>
<p>We will now try to implement some of these patterns in the Application we started last week. In this lab we will introduce a second screen to display the list of donations made by the user. In addition, we will explore some of the menu support provided by android, the notion of and "Application Object" and also "Adapters". These features will enable our app to be equipped with its first "Model" objects, which will be used to store the individual donations made by the user. At the end of this lab is a series of 'Challenges', some if which are straightforward, others are more complicated. See how far you get with them. </p>
<p>If you have completed this lab (but not the exercises yet) then we can review your achievements so far, and closely inspect the code we introduced to accommodate the new activity + the list. We will also review the challenges:</p>
