  <blockquote>
    <p>We will now try to implement some of these patterns in the Application we started last week. In this lab we will introduce a second screen to display the list of donations made by the user. In addition, we will explore some of the menu support provided by android, the notion of and "Application Object" and also "Adapters". These features will enable our app to be equipped with its first "Model" objects, which will be used to store the individual donations made by the user. At the end of this lab is a series of 'Challenges', some if which are straightforward, others are more complicated. See how far you get with them.</p>
